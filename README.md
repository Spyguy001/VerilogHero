# VerilogHero
Guitar hero style rhythm game in verilog

Milestone #1:
=============
For our first milestone, we will make one note fall across the screen. 
We will make the note generation random, and SW inputs as a backup for 
the note. We will use the KEY inputs to check if the bottom-most note is 
what the user inputs. The HEX display will show the score, which can be 
reset using a switch.

Milestone #2:
=============
We will have multiple notes instead of just 1. We will integrate the 
keyboard and make it check the bottom-most notes instead of the KEY 
inputs. We will integrate sound into the project, with one sound for the 
correct score, and more sounds if time allows.

Milestone #3:
=============
We will integrate a change of speed at which the notes fall down the 
screen. If there's enough time, we will make the score display on the 
screen as well as a two player system instead of just one person playing 
the game. That system would have two displays of the notes with each 
player controlling either side and two different scores.
